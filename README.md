# Ocean Water Analysis

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find a dataset named `bottle.csv` containing data from various ocean water examinations. We're particularly interested in the relationship between water salinity and temperature. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi?select=bottle.csv).

Our goal is to predict water temperature based on salinity.

## Dataset
The dataset `bottle.csv` consists of the following columns:
- Salinity: Measurement of salt concentration in the water.
- Temperature: Measurement of water temperature.
- Other columns: Additional information may be present, but for our analysis, we're focusing on salinity and temperature.
